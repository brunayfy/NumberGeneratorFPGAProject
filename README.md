Implement:
* Multiplier implemented using FOR GENERATE based on exercise 7.6.6 of D'Amore book.
* Mux using concurrent statement: WITH-SELECT.
* Subtractor using FOR GENERATE with component for full subtractor. 
* Left shift (<<2) using FUNCTION.
* FF type D using PROCEDURE.

# How it works
The pseudo-randown number is generated by the logic: 
```
x(i+1) = r * x(i) * (1 - x(i))

in which:
0 < r    <= 4 (being 4 the maximum caos)
0 < x(i) <  1

So that x(i+1) is:
x(i+1) = 4 * x(i) * (1 -x(i))
x(i+1) = x(i) * (1 -x(i)) <<2
```
The x value is used in the Q-format Q.N where all N bits represents the decimal part.

In Q-format, bits represents decimals in power of 1/2^n starting with 0.5 and then 0.25, 0,125...

You can get the decimal value by converting the binary output to decimal and dividing it by 2^n. 

For a chosen r, it's important to take care about the starting value because some of then will generate bad sequences of random number,s for example (case where r=4): <br />
```Xo â‰  [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]```
# Research :
Fixed point(Q-format) Q.N(number of bits).
